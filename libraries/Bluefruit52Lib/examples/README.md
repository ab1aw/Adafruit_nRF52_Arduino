Proxy Repeater

This project demonstrates how to implement dual-role BLE device that subscribes to a single peripheral and relays notifications, alarms and data/commands between a peripheral and an end-user client app.


Peripheral Aggregator

This project demonstrates how to implement dual-role BLE device that subscribes to multiple peripherals and relays notifications, alarms and data/commands between a peripheral and an end-user client app.


Aggregation and Translation (HRM and HTM)

These two projects demonstrate how to implement dual-role BLE device that subscribes to multiple peripheral devices, aggregates and translates the data notifications and alarms from those devices, and advertises itself as a single service which publishes notifications and data derived from the peripherals.
